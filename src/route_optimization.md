Based on the BART schedule data, there are no direct routes from the Salesforce Transit Center to Richmond BART that depart around 8:00 AM. The earliest available option is the LA route, which departs Salesforce Transit Center at 5:10 PM and arrives at Richmond Parkway Transit Center at 6:00 PM.

However, I can recommend the following multi-leg journey that provides a more suitable option:

1. Take the Yellow-S route from Salesforce Transit Center to Daly City BART Station, departing at 7:40 AM and arriving at 8:15 AM.
2. Transfer to the Richmond-bound Red-N route at Daly City BART.
3. Take the Red-N route from Daly City BART to Richmond BART, departing at 8:20 AM and arriving at 9:00 AM.

This route takes approximately 1 hour and 20 minutes and costs $2.50. It provides a direct connection from Salesforce Transit Center to Richmond BART with a convenient transfer at Daly City BART.

Some additional backup options to consider:
- Take the Yellow-S route from Salesforce Transit Center to Daly City BART, then transfer to the Richmond-bound Yellow-N route.
- Take an earlier Yellow-S route from Salesforce Transit Center to Daly City BART, then wait for the next available Richmond-bound Red-N train.

All BART stations and trains are wheelchair accessible, and I recommend letting the station staff know if you have any special needs so they can assist you.

I hope this transit plan helps you get to Richmond BART on time. Let me know if you have any other questions!
