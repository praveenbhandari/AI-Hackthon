     * Get messages associated with a run with filtering options.
     *
     * Args:
     *     run_id: ID of the run
     *     before: A cursor for use in pagination. `before` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, starting with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include before=obj_foo in order to fetch the previous page of the list.
     *     after: A cursor for use in pagination. `after` is an object ID that defines your place in the list. For instance, if you make a list request and receive 100 objects, ending with obj_foo, your subsequent call can include after=obj_foo in order to fetch the next page of the list.
     *     limit: Maximum number of messages to return
     *     order: Sort order by the created_at timestamp of the objects. asc for ascending order and desc for descending order.
     *     role: Filter by role (user/assistant/system/tool)
     *     return_message_object: Whether to return Message objects or LettaMessage objects
     *     user_id: ID of the user making the request
     *
     * Returns:
     *     A list of messages associated with the run. Default is List[LettaMessage].

     * @param {Letta.runs.MessagesListRequest} request
